<h1 style="color:orange;">Welcom to Jack's game pit.</h1>insane
<p><strong style="color:orange;">The Game pit is a hole in the ground that is said to have no end.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">This is where i put my ideas and my finished games. everything i've made has been thrown into the hole.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">some never to see the light of day.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">others to be my pride and joy.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">for you it might not seem very big.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">but for me it is one big empty room waiting to be filled.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">for me it is the stories that i have yet to make.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">it is the advenchers that have yet to be taken.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">games of life, death, and the ever evolving state of my fantasies.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">so of that which ye can see enjoy.
