<h1 style="color:orange;">The Nite Stalker</h1>insane
<p><strong style="color:orange;">The Nite Stalker is an idea i've had since the beginning of my game design endeavors.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">it involves many things that i've enjoyed in the horror shannara. spirit cameras, monsters, insanity and so on.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">there's a reason i'm not going to go into detail.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">and i won't tell i can copyright it.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">entel i own my story nun of you will hear it.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">it is sad i can't trust any of you.
<p><strong style="color:orange;">But you all know how easy it is for someone to steal a thot.
